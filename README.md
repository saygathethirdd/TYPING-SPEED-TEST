# TYPING-SPEED-TEST
Typing Speed Test ⌨️

A simple typing speed test built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal of this project was to focus on core JavaScript logic, timing, accuracy calculation, and DOM interaction — without relying on frameworks.

Features

Timed typing test (30s / 60s)

WPM (Words Per Minute) calculation

Accuracy percentage

Difficulty levels (Easy / Medium / Hard)

Passage-based typing mode

Restartable test

Dark / Light mode toggle

Fully responsive layout

Tech Stack

HTML – structure

CSS – layout and visual design

JavaScript (ES Modules) – logic and interactivity

Focus & Learning Goals

This project was built primarily as a JavaScript learning exercise, with emphasis on:

Timer logic using setInterval

Real-time input comparison

State handling (difficulty, mode, timing)

DOM querying and updates

Incremental refactoring

The styling layer exists to support usability and clarity rather than to showcase advanced CSS techniques.

Styling Note

The visual design was adapted from a modern UI reference and customized to fit the project’s structure and behavior.
The primary effort and learning focus of this project lies in the JavaScript functionality and logic, not in original visual design experimentation.

Future Improvements

Highlight correct / incorrect words while typing

Progress bar timer

Better mobile keyboard handling

Improved passage randomization

Accessibility improvements
